    <Body className={classes.body}>Having moved to Berlin in 2016 from London, a city with an abundance of gluten free choice, she found herself searching for a tool that would fill the empty gluten free hole in Berlin. Two years later after discovering these GF locations, she decided to design her own map to help others in need who are visting, have just moved, or are living in Berlin.</Body>
